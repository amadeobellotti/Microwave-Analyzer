120307
Branched out a Prologix_Ethernet version to java.net
Added a new GPIB controller GPIB_Prologix_Ethernet
Modified the constructor of GPIB_Prologix to store if native drivers or Ethernet 
should be used


120305

added Agilent4155.genericGPIBinstrument

120228
added an extra StopScripting check in MonitorChart

added WhatsNew dialog
fixed Agilent4155.configDisplayAxis
started with Keithley 2600

120221
debugged GPIB_NI.Send after Scott unraveled that saveIDN? sends *IDN? and a \n (or "")
exporting result of last command to Python Interpreter as _ans
added Device.Query

120206
tested on Lab Computer after merging with IOtech branch
fixed minor bugs
iC dir is now copied to the dist folder (javadoc is updated)

120203
merged IOtech branch into trunk

120124
debugged with the IOtech attached on Paul's computer
fixed Regex for parsing Generic GPIB Instruments
changed RS232_Driver.TimeOut from 100 to 250ms (for the IOtech to work properly)

120122
renamed dir Generic GPIB Instruments to Generic Instruments
added local javadoc

120119
tweaked logging subversion number
iC_Properties now closes the iC_User.properties file

120118
subversion number is now logged in iC_Logger

120109
ListTransferHandler is not a private class of IcontrolView, deleted iC_Logger
more clean-up for the paper

120105
GPIB_IOtech should roughly work now. getStatusByte and CloseController are missing

120102
implemented IOtech.Send and checkCommunicationError

111216
found that library .jar files are copied twice to dist folder: once inside the
Icontrol.jar (because the library jar files were stored under the src directory)
and once in the lib directory (Project Directory/Build/Packaging/Copy Dependent 
Libraries). These jars need to be in lib, so the files were moved to the _misc folder

Updated from JFreeChart 1.0.13 to 1.0.14


111215
EurothermTC: fixed WriteA32bitValue, setRampRate
implemented and tested ReadA32bitValue, getProcessvalue

111213
renamed iC.debug to iC.Debug
added iC_User.properties to iC "distribution" folder
selected GPIB controller is now saved as default selection when pressing Start

111212
convenience method RS232_Driver.ByteBufferToString
cleaned up EurothermTC.setSP1, added setRamp1, 
checkLoopBack is now called (all untested yet)

111210
cont' working on IOtech RS232-GPIB controller

111205
found the bug in CRC calculation of Eurotherm (needs further cleanup)
branched out Icontrol_IOtechBranch
started implementing support for IOtech Micro488 RS232-GPIB controller

111130 revision 348
merged Jython branch into trunk
now storing the path to the iC directory (Startup.py was not found)

111129
corrected Regex in Tokenizer which stripped off the / of a path instead of comments
implemented INCLUDE zyx.py

111128
Python integration should be more or less done (including javadoc)

111126
added Device.iSPaused and changed code in the Instruments that used isPaused, adapted javadoc
added is_paused to Startup.py
checked how to use return values in Python

111123
Jython appears to work
single and multiple Python commands can now be sent

111107
Lakeshore340.UpdateCalibrationData: choosing no interpolation curve should work

111104
updated Apache Commons Math from 2.1 to 2.2
allow to choose between Loess and Linear Interpolation for Temperature 
    calibration (work in progress)
debugged LakeshoreTC.autoSetPoint

111103
Serial Number for Input Curves (Lakeshore 340) is now MonthDate
the last script loaded/saved last is now loaded automatically when iC.Debug=1
added Lakeshore340.readCalibrationPoints
now displaying 10000 data points max (manual GC might work)


111102
added manual garbage collection after displaying 500 data points in the hope to
prevent further out-of-memory crashes
worked on some minor ToDo's and bugfixes in setTempCalibrate
changed default log level in debug mode from ALL to FINER
iControlView.getFileName(String) now adds a counter if the file exists

111027
yesterday an OutOfMemory crashed iC.
in GPIB_NI in CloseController the ByteBuffer is released and GarbageCollection started
added Lakeshore340.setTempCalibrate

111026
debugged iC_ChartXY.AddXYDataPoint(ID, X[], Y[]): did not update correctly and did not show last data point
continued improving Lakeshore340.addCalibrationData and .UpdateSensorCurve
implemented LakeshoreTC.SetTemp with better wait for temperature
ChangeLog is now in a separate file
added (almost empty) skeleton for a HP3561 Dynamic Signal Analyzer

111020
continued improving Lakeshore340.addCalibrationData and .UpdateSensorCurve
iC_Instrument.WaitForUser is now modeless

111019
added LakeshoreTC.autoSetPoint and iC_ChartXY.ClearSeries
debugged Lakeshore340.addCalibrationData and .UpdateSensorCurve
started with making iC_Instrument.WaitForUser a non-modal (modeless) Dialog

111012
added iC_Instrument.WaitDate

110921
added WaitForUser in iC_Instruments
changed LakeshoreTC.Epsilon from 0.1 to 0.5 (sometimes the temperature change was 
so high that the epsilon was too small

110919
Apparently the set point temperature is not changed when the command is sent
directly after changing the ramp rate on a Lakeshore 332. No error was generated. 
This was confirmed by sending RAMP 2,0,10.000\n\rSETP 2, 70 using NI Measurement
and Automation Explorer. Adding a 100ms delay after setting the ramp rate helped. 
Also added a 100 ms delay in other methods in LakeshoreTC.

110916
sub-scripts that do not include a full path are now searched first in the Project directory,
then in the default iC directory
sub-scripts can now also contain MAKE commands
changed Test_Scripts (in _misc) to Development_Scripts and Example_Scripts

110914
fixed GUI bug (clear table and end editing when a different instrument/command is selected)

110806
added Agilent4155: disable a SMU (not yet tested)

110727
Agilent4155.configDisplayAxis did not set Y2 axis (but Y1 axis instead)

110722
the last Project Directory is now remembered
branched out a RS232branch on the SVN repository
cleaned up the main repository (I hope)

110721
added configDisplayAxis() to 4155
branched out a MCCdaq branch
deleted MCCdaq stuff from this trunk version

110720
added logX/logY option to 4155.PlotData
removed auto cal on and display:window:state 1 from 4155.Close to not change the
display when sequencing done. was unnecessary anyways


110708 
fixed Agilent4155.configSweep (error setting VAR2 number of points)
added JFreeChart-1.0.x.jar which should prevent the queing of events that cuases
the unresponsivness of iC. Select this jar in the project properties instead
of JFreeChart-1.0.13.jar

110707
fixed Agilent4155.SaveData (data was not saved with the proper file name)
Agilent4155 can now plot XY charts of data

110705
add lin/log scaling to Popup menu of iC_ChartXY
HP4192 now selects log scaling of frequency axis when log frequency sweep was selected

110609
make max number of data points shown in a Chart an iC_Property (to prevent a bug)

110606 (1.0.259)
Agilent4155 made SaveData() public
minor bug fix with escaped () in parsing generic GPIB command definitions

Release version is 1.0.258, date 110523
