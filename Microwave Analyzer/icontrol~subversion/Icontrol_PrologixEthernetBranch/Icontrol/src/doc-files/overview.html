<h2>Instrument Control (iC) - Overview</h2>


<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Automate (scientific)
test equipment via GPIB (IEEE 488.2) with this JAVA
program.</span> <br>
</p>
<p>It has become common practice to automate data acquisition from
programmable instrumentation and a range of different software
solutions fulfill this task. Many routine measurements require
sequential processing of certain tasks, for instance to adjust the
temperature of a sample stage, take a measurement, and repeat that
cycle for other temperatures. Instrument Control (iC) is an open-source
Java program that processes a series of text-based commands that define
the measurement sequence. These commands are in an intuitive format
which provides great flexibility and allows quick and easy adaptation
to various measurement needs. For each of these commands, the
iC-framework calls a corresponding Java method that addresses the
specified instrument to perform the desired task. The way iC was
designed enables one to quickly extend the functionality of Instrument
Control with minimal programming effort in Java, by writing Python scripts, or by defining new commands in
a text file without any programming.</p>
KPP dedicates this work in devotion to Bhagavan Sri Sathya
Sai Baba.

<h3><a name="Supported_GPIB_controllers"></a>Supported GPIB controllers<br>
</h3>
The Instrument Control (iC) program has been tested with the following configurations:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Windows XP: National Instruments PCI-GPIB card with NI 488.2
(version 2.4) drivers - this is the typical configuration and most work
was done using this configuration<br>
</li>
  <li>Windows XP: Agilent 82357B USB/GPIB interface with the
Agilent IO Suite (version 15.1) - an *IDN? query worked as expected; no
more tests were performed<br>
</li>
  
  <li>Windows XP: Prologix GPIB-USB controller (version 4.2
and 6.0) with the&nbsp; direct drivers (version&nbsp; 2.08.08) - the
program logged 5 temperatures every second for 20 h without problems</li>
  <li>Windows 7: IOtech Micro 488/A GPIB-RS232 controller - the program
sucessfully set the frequency and amplitude of an HP frequency
generator.<br>
  </li>

  <li>Mac
OS 10.6: National Instruments GPIB-USB-HS controller with NI 488.2
(version 2.5) - an *IDN? query worked as expected; no more tests were
performed</li>


  

</ul>

<h3><a name="System_requirements"></a>System requirements</h3>A Java SE
Runtime Environment (version 6.0 or later)
and one of the above GPIB cards with the appropriate
drivers installed should be enough to run the program.<br>
<br>



<h3><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</h3>
<h4>
Release version</h4>
<ul>
<li>Download the zip-file and extract it to folder of your choice.</li><li>Double-click on the <code>Icontrol.jar</code> file to run. If your system is not configured to run .jar files read this <a href="http://netbeans.org/kb/articles/javase-deploy.html#troubleshooting">instruction</a>.</li>
  <li>If you like, you can copy the 'iC' folder to your home directory so that it is neatly stowed away. If
you are not sure what directory is the user's home directory start the
program which will present a dialog showing the user's directory.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Developer's version</h4>
<ul>
<li>Download and install the <a href="http://netbeans.org/downloads/7.0.1/" target="_blank">Netbeans IDE v7.0.1 with the Java Development Kit</a>. Use Netbeans version 7.0.1 as later versions do not support the Swing Application framework!<br>
</li><li>Register at <a href="http://kenai.com/">kenai.com</a> and subscribe to the <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/icontrol">Instrument Control project</a>.</li><li>In
Netbeans, log into the Team Server (Team/Team Server/Login ...). You
might have to install the Team server support (Tools/Plugins: Team
Server) and the SVN bundle.<br>
</li><li>Get
the Source code (Team/Team Server/Open Team Project...). There might be
multiple repository folders. The 'Icontrol' directory contains the
latest development source code, while other directories are branches to
develop certain funtionality, for instance support for RS232
communication. Once development in those branches is finished, they
will be merged into 'Icontrol'.<br>

    <a href="doc-files/CheckOutPage.png"><img title="Click to enlarge" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 500px; height: 234px;" alt="Check out page" src="doc-files/CheckOutPage.png"></a><br>
</li><li>Compile the source code by pressing 'Clean&amp;Build'. This
also copies the 'iC' directory to the user's home directory.<br>
</li>
  <li>To access additional libraries when starting the program from Netbeans, add <code>-Djava.library.path=${dist.dir}</code> to the VM Options in the project's properties. This setting appears not to be synched by svn.<br>
  </li>
<li>Run the program by clicking the green 'Play' button in Netbeans.</li>
  <li>Once compiled, the .jar file (in the 'dist' directory) can be started from outside Netbeans.</li>
  <li>To
generate local javadoc, set the correct path in the project properties
(Build/Documentation) and then right click on the Icontrol project in
Netbeans and choose Generate Javadoc.<br>
</li>
  <li>[Advanced users]: To enable debug mode add 'iC.Debug=1' to
the Run arguments in the Project properties, or simply add the line to
the <code>iC_User.properties</code> file in the iC directory.<br>
 </li>
  
  <li>[Advanced users]: If you like to access JFreeChart's source code directly from within Netbeans, install <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/download.html">JFreeChart</a>
as described in the included installation instructions, and add the
path to the source code to the project properties (Library/Include)
accordingly. A copy of JFreeChart
is also included in the _misc directory in the source code. The javadoc
should be accessible from Netbeans because a zip-ed version of
JFreeChart's javadoc is included (and referenced) in the _misc
directory.</li>

<h3><a name="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h3>
<ul><li>I cannot access the source code on kenai.com.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>You need to register (for free) at Kenai.com and become a
member of the Instrument Control project. Registration is required to
manage check-out/commit permissions.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Which command line arguments are supported?</li>

  <ul>
    <li>It is possible to set every property using the general form:<br>
      <code>PropertyName=Value<br>
      </code>for instance: <code>iC.Debug=1</code> or <code>iC.Debug=0</code><br>
Note that no spaces are allowed.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Can I use iC on non-Windows machines (Mac, Linux)?</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Yes, see the section <a href="#Supported_GPIB_controllers">Supported GPIB controllers</a> above.<br>
</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Why does iC log the GPIB traffic?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Why not? I once experimented with very high-voltage and there
it happened (I should not admit that, but well - you asked) that when
my decive broke down (at a few kV), the computer standing next to the
device (and me) crashed on a regular basis, and to recover the last
data point(s), a GPIB log came in handy. It is also helpful
during debuggin, and serves as a last-resort-backup of the measured data. You can disable GPIB logging from the Options Menu. To
disable GPIB logging permanently, change the file <code>iC.properties</code> or <code>iC_User.properties</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>How can I change the <code>iC.properties</code> file in the distribution version?</li><ul><li>First a question: Why do you want to? All properties can also be changed in the file <code>iC_User.properties</code> which resides in the home directory.</li></ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Rename <span style="font-style: italic;">Icontrol.jar</span> to&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Icontrol.jar.zip</span></li>
    <li>Browse the content and copy the file 'icontrol/resources/iC.properties' to a temporary folder, for instance the Desktop</li>
    <li>Make desired changes using a text editor</li>
    <li>Replace the old file with the new one<code></code> <br>
    </li>
    <li>Reanme <span style="font-style: italic;">Icontrol.jar.zip</span> to <span style="font-style: italic;">Icontrol.jar</span>&nbsp;</li>

  </ul>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Known_issues"></a>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Charts</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Only the last 1000 data point are displayed in a chart (all
data points are saved though). This is because the Java Virtual Machine
crashed repeatedly when 5 charts where displayed simultaneously during
testing of iC after displaying. <br>
</li>
    <li>Displaying many data points on a chart slows down the
response of iC. This is because events to update the chart are queued
and I don't know how to hook into the event queue.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
